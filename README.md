> **Teach, don’t solve** — an AI mentor that helps learners debug Python code through hints and reflective questions, without giving away the solution.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates an **AI Debugging Assistant Prompt** designed to help students debug Python code in a **supportive, non-revealing way**.  
The AI acts like a **mentor**, offering hints, probing questions, and debugging strategies — but never the direct answer.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **`debug_prompt.txt`** → The main AI prompt that defines assistant behavior.  
- **`reasoning.md`** → In-depth explanation of tone, style, design choices, and adaptations for different learners.  
- **`README.md`** → Project overview, summary reasoning, and quick usage guide.  

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Identifies logical & syntactic issues in Python code  
- ✅ Provides **constructive hints** instead of fixes  
- ✅ Uses **probing questions** to encourage reflection  
- ✅ Maintains a **friendly, mentor-like tone**  
- ✅ Adaptable for **beginners and advanced learners**  

---

## 🔧 Usage

1. Copy the contents of `debug_prompt.txt`.  
2. Paste it into any AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, OpenAI API).  
3. Provide the student’s Python code as input.  
4. The AI will:
   - Highlight potential bugs  
   - Suggest debugging strategies  
   - Ask reflective questions  
   - Encourage independent problem-solving  

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Mentor-based approach** → AI behaves like a teacher, not a solver.  
- **Focus on reflection** → Students build debugging *skills*, not just fix errors.  
- **Clear "Do NOT" rules** → Prevents solution leakage.  
- **Scaffolded guidance** → Works for both beginners (step-by-step hints) and advanced learners (conceptual questions).
